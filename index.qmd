# Preface to _A Little Book of Bioinformatics_ {.unnumbered}

Welcome to A Little Book of Bioinformatics. This is an online book, under continual development, which I am building as and when topics come to mind or prominence.

My goal is that this online book will come to be a fairly transparent and honest reference for students in bioinformatics, and maybe for some researchers, too.

I would be very grateful for feedback [by email]({{< var admin.email >}}) or through the [GitHub repository Issues page]({{< var github.issues >}})
