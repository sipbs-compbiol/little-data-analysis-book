Our argument for this kind of causal relationship might run as follows:\n\nPenguins with big flippers tend to be large and, because they also tend to have more penguin in them, they will necessarily weigh more.\n\n\\[ F \\rightarrow W  \\tag{1}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe don’t have the arrow pointing the other way, as it doesn’t seem as reasonable to argue that increasing the weight of a penguin necessarily increases that penguin’s flipper length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nOur scientific model considers the directionality of influence: it is a causal model. But linear regression will only tell us about the association between the variables. We must use this causal model to interpret the result.\n\n\nWe can formally say that penguin weight is some function of flipper size, and represent that with Equation 2:\n\\[ W = f(F)  \\tag{2}\\]\n\nIncorporating real world variation\nLooking at Figure 1 we can see that the relationship between penguin body mass and flipper size isn’t exactly a straight line. This reflects real-world variation in the dataset that is the result of other influences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe don’t know, or even need to know, what those influences are - though candidate might include\n\nmeasurement error\nthe influence of recent fish catch successes on a penguin’s stomach contents\nthe day on which the penguin was measured\npenguin sex\nthe condition/illness of the penguin\n\nor any of several other factors.\n\n\nThese other influences can be treated as unobserved influences, which we represent as a single causal influence on \\(W\\) in Equation 3 by the \\(\\enclose{circle}{U}\\) symbol (the circle means that the variable is unobserved, or unmeasured).\n\\[ F \\rightarrow W \\leftarrow \\enclose{circle}{U}  \\tag{3}\\]\nSo we now say that penguin weight is some function of flipper size and the unobserved variable \\(U\\), and represent that with Equation 4:\n\\[ W = f(F,U)  \\tag{4}\\]",

    "text": "The Statistical Model\nWe have a scientific model of how we believe the system relating flipper size to penguin weight works. But we must now construct a statistical model which will allow us to define and estimate the associations between measured variables.\n\nSimulating the system\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThere are many good reasons why we would want to simulate our system before analysing the data. In this case, with such a simple association, it might seem like overkill: there’s an “obvious” linear relationship, so let’s go straight to a linear fit. But here we want to focus on the process as much as anything else, so we will work through each step as though we were dealing with a much more complex model.\nIn many systems the underlying complexity can build up quite rapidly, and it may not be so obvious that our model (e.g. as defined in Equation 3 and Equation 4) captures its behaviour. Following this process will protect against some of the negative effects of that.\nSimulating the system as we understand it, where we are in control of the parameters, allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our approach, and the precision and accuracy of our fit when estimating the effect of, say, flipper size on penguin weight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA big advantage of simulating the system is that it can give us confidence, and avoid giving us false confidence.\nIf we can’t recover the actual values in our simulated system - using our data analysis approach - then we shouldn’t have much confidence that it will do a better job on the real data. But if we can reliably recover those values from the simulated system, then so long as our model is a good representation of the real world we might draw some confidence from this.\n\n\nWe’re going to turn Equation 3 into a mathematical equation that has parameters we can estimate, so that we can try to determine the association between flipper size and weight. We represent the result in Equation 5.\n\\[ W = \\beta F + U  \\tag{5}\\]\nThis equation says that the weight of a penguin \\(W\\) can be expressed as some proportion (\\(\\beta\\)) of its flipper size \\(F\\), plus some unobserved value \\(U\\) representing variational noise in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOur ultimate goal is to estimate \\(\\beta\\), the association between flipper size \\(F\\) and weight \\(W\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou will have noticed that, although we measure \\(W\\) and \\(F\\) directly, we have not measured \\(U\\) and, indeed, we cannot measure \\(U\\). The value of \\(U\\) changes from individual to individual, and we must make assumptions about it, in order to include it in our simulation.\nWe assume that the value of \\(U\\) for an individual is drawn from a distribution of possible values. Here we’re going to assume that this is:\n\na Normal (Gaussian) distribution\nwhich has mean of zero (0)\na standard deviation of some size yet to be determined\n\nThis represents random “noise” in the data that is centred around zero.\n\n\nWe can write our simulation in R. Here, sim_weight() is a function we can call to generate simulated weight data. We need to pass it three arguments:\n\nF: a vector of flipper sizes\nbeta: the parameter in Equation 5 determining the relationship between flipper size and penguin weight\nsd: the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution representing \\(U\\)\n\n\nsim_weight &lt;- function(F, beta, sd) {\n  U &lt;- rnorm(length(F), 0, sd)\n  W &lt;- beta * F + U\n  return(W)\n}\n\nTo use sim_weight() we need to give it a vector of flipper size values. We’ll generate these uniformly-distributed values in the range we saw in Figure 1, using R’s runif() function, and plot the result below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAt this point, we do not know the real values of beta/\\(\\beta\\) or sd. We’re just going to use some values that seem reasonable\n\n\n\nF &lt;- runif(200, min=170, max=230)\nW &lt;- sim_weight(F, beta=25, sd=250)\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(body_mass_g=W, flipper_length_mm=F)\n\nggplot(data, aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_point(shape=21, colour=\"darkolivegreen3\", stroke=2) +\n  xlab(\"flipper length (mm)\") + ylab(\"body mass(g)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe first thing we want to do is check that the values are in the kind of range we expect, that they are realistic. Here that means we want to confirm that no individuals in the simulations are incredibly light or heavy, or have extremely long or short flipper lengths.\nIf we do notice major differences between our model and the data, then we can adjust our model, or our parameter choices accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nDescribing the model\nWe need to describe our simulation model in terms of conventional statistical notation. We list our variables, defining each variable as a deterministic or distributional function of the other variables.\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n&W_i = \\beta F_i + U_i \\\\\n&U_i \\sim \\textrm{Normal}(0, \\sigma) \\\\\n&F_i \\sim \\textrm{Uniform}(170, 230)\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nIn Equation 6, we use the subscript term \\(_i\\) to indicate the value for an individual observation with index \\(i\\). The first penguin has index 1, the second has index 2, and so on. Each individual penguin has its own measurement of weight \\(W_i\\) and flipper size \\(F_i\\), and is subject to an individual influence from unobserved causes \\(U_i\\).\nThe first line of the definition \\(W_i = \\beta F_i + U_i\\) is a restatement of Equation 5, the equation for expected weight (given flipper size), being specific about it applying to an individual penguin. The Gaussian noise \\(U_i\\) is sampled from a Gaussian (Normal) distribution centred on zero, with some (as yet unknown) variance, and where the penguin’s flipper size is drawn from a uniform distribution of lengths between 170 and 230 mm.\n\n\nConstructing the Estimator\nWe want to estimate how the average weight of a penguin changes with the length of the penguin’s flipper. This is represented in Equation 7\n\\[ \\textrm{E}(W_i|F_i) = \\alpha + \\beta F_i  \\tag{7}\\]\nHere, \\(\\textrm{E}(W_i|F_i)\\) represents the expected (or average) weight of a penguin (\\(W_i\\)), conditional on its flipper size (\\(F_i\\)). The relationship between the two is described as the expression \\(\\alpha + \\beta F_i\\) - describing a linear relationship where \\(\\alpha\\) is the intercept and \\(\\beta\\) is the slope of the line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe model in Equation 7 describes a relationship where an individual with a flipper size of zero should also have a weight of zero, which seems intiutively reasonable.\nWe can use the relationships and implications defined in these models to look at violations of the model, which may be opportunities for improving the model and our understanding of the system.\n\n\nWe’re going to use a Bayesian approach to estimate values for \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\sigma\\) as described in the equation for the posterior distribution, Equation 8.\n\\[ \\textrm{Pr}(\\alpha, \\beta, \\sigma|F_i,W_i) = \\frac{\\textrm{Pr}(W_i|F_i, \\alpha, \\beta, \\sigma) \\textrm{Pr}(\\alpha, \\beta, \\sigma)}{Z}  \\tag{8}\\]\nHere, \\(Z\\) is a normalising constant that we’re not going to consider in detail.\nThe statistical model is then:\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nW_i \\sim \\textrm{Normal}(\\mu_i, \\sigma)\n\\mu_i = \\alpha + \\beta F_i\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\tag{9}\\]\nwhich describes how \\(W_i\\) varies in relation to \\(F_i\\). Equation 9 describes how \\(W_i\\) is drawn from a Normal distribution with standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) and mean \\(\\mu_i\\), where \\(\\mu_i\\) is dependent on the value of \\(F_i\\) through the relationship \\(\\alpha + \\beta F_i\\).",

This, by itself, is counterintuitive and unhelpful to a reader, but is compounded because there is both “positive loss” (i.e. weight loss), and “negative loss” (i.e. weight gain).\nThis labelling means the reader needs to invert the intuitive direction of change and keep in mind that “negative loss” means gain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipImproving the figure\n\n\n\nThe y-axis could have been presented as “% Weight Change” so that values above zero represent weight gain, and those below zero represent weight loss. This would be more intuitive and not require the reader to keep in mind that “negative loss” is the same as “gain.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: “Bacterial burden in mouse peritoneal lavage fluid 24 hours after infection with two bacterial isolates”\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows counts of bacteria in peritoneal lavage, 24h post infection. Bacterial counts are typically found as counts of colony-forming units (CFU). Because these counts are large numbers and bacterial growth is exponential, they are often presented as log(CFU). So, if \\(\\textrm{CFU} = 100000 = 10^5\\), \\(\\log_{10}{\\textrm{(CFU)}} = 5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantPresent log data incorrectly\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2 the numerical values on the y-axis are actual bacterial CFU counts, but the label indicates that they are \\(\\log_{10}\\textrm{(CFU)}\\) counts. If that were actually the case, the lowest count on the y-axis (100,000) would represent \\(10^{100000}\\), a much larger number than is practical in an experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipImproving the figure\n\n\n\nThe y-axis values in Figure 2 are \\(10^5\\), \\(10^6\\), and \\(10^7\\), so the numerical values for an axis labelled as “\\(\\log_{10}\\textrm{(CFU)}\\)” should be 5, 6, and 7.\nAlternatively, the units on the axis could have been presented as CFU/mL, in which case the numerical values would have been correct.",

Each bar represents the mean ± SEM.”\n\n\n\nIn Figure 3, the error bars are only shown in one direction, although SEM is typically understood (and stated here explicitly) to extend either side of an estimate of the mean. This kind of figure is known as a “dynamite plot” and obscures the true variation of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantDynamite plots don’t show data variation accurately\n\n\n\nFigure 3 is an example of a “dynamite plot” where an error bar that should extend either side of the mean is only shown in one direction. The visualisation implies that error only occurs in one direction, and obscures or prevents comparison of the variation of data between groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipImproving the figure\n\n\n\nError bars should always be shown to extend in both directions around an estimate, where variation (or estimates of variation) do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: “Absolute macrophage counts in the peritoneal cavity 24 hours after infection.”\n\n\n\nFigure 4 shows count data (which can only have a value of zero or greater) of macrophages in the peritoneal cavity of mice, 24h post infection, for two bacterial isolates. The original legend did not indicate the meaning of the error bars, but the surrounding figures state that error bars represent SEM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantDynamite plots disguise statistical errors\n\n\n\nThe Figure 4 error bar for S. Typhimurium only extends vertically above the mean absolute macrophage count. This is a “dynamite plot” and undesirable because it is not truly representing the (here, presumed to be SEM) actual estimate of error. But in this case it is also disguising a much more significant statistical error.\nCareful inspection of the length of the Typhimurium error bar shows that it is larger than the estimated mean. This implies that the SEM error bar in the other direction should extend below the zero count. **This is equivalent to stating that (i) it is possible to have a negative count of macrophages, and (ii) that the uncertainty in the data is such that the mean count might be negative.\nObviously, the true count cannot be negative, but the statistical analysis implicitly allows/assumes it to be possible. This should strongly guide the researcher towards a different statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipImproving the figure\n\n\n\nIn this case, the usual solution of simply showing the error bar properly above and below the mean estimate will not solve all the issues, although following good practice this way might have helped the analysis.\nHere, the key is to note that the data is count data which specifically can only take counts of zero or greater. This kind of data can sometimes be understood to follow a Normal distribution without causing problems, but more generally is better represented by a different kind of statistical distribution.\nTo avoid the impossibility of the implications of a Normal distribution/SEM here, a boxplot or violin plot could have been used to visualise the data distribution.",
